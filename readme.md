**DESCRIPTION:** This assignment is from The Odin Project Web Development track [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms).

***

The purpose of this project was to recreate the sign-up form for [mint.com](https://wwws.mint.com/login.event?task=S). The page is marked up using HTML 5, specifically the newer semantic elements (&lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, etc).  It is styled with CSS3, using the typical styling like colors, padding, margins, and typography.  The page uses Flexbox for its layout.

The page can be viewed [here](https://larissagrayson.github.io/html-forms/).
